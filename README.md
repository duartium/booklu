# ðŸ“š Booklu - Book Recommendations Engine ðŸš€

Welcome to Booklu, Book Recommendations Website! This is an open-source project that uses design patterns and best programming practices to create a dynamic and user-friendly book recommendations engine.

## Why BOOKLU?

Recommendation engines are a crucial part of the digital economy, driving personalized suggestions on platforms like Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify. However, finding personalized book recommendations can be a challenge. Our aim with BRE is to fill this gap and create an open-source book recommendations engine that is easy to implement and use.

## How does it work?

BRE uses a variety of algorithms and design patterns to provide personalized recommendations. We're implementing the Factory pattern, Singleton pattern among others, to ensure the code is easy to read, understand, and maintain.

## Dataset
